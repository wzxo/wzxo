## About me

Hello, I'm zxo. I chose this username because the *real* "zxo" username was taken. I code on computers, have a GitHub account, 
and also have an email (zxoclm@protonmail.com).

I don't think I'm that good at computers because my code doesn't work. One bug in the code, take down a bug and fix it, three bugs in the code, 
as I think when trying to figure out where the bug is in the code.

I also use Linux, did you know.

I can type my password at lightning speed because I log out too much.

also funny joke: openSUS *(play the amogus music)*.

I ran out of ideas so nothing to put on this line. :c
